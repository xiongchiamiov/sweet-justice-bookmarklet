This is a somewhat hacky bookmarklet for sweet-justice.  It will justify all `<p>`s on a page when accessed, yay.

Until I make something a bit more proper (bah, morning classes!), right-click on Firefox's bookmark bar (I really have no idea if you can do this in other browsers), and make a new bookmark.  In the location, copy+paste the content of justify.js.  Click your fancy new bookmark when you want to justify a page.  Hooray.
